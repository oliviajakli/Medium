# Collection of Code for Medium
Hello there 👋🏻 Pleased to meet you.

I'm Olivia, a recent CS graduate and aspiring Data Scientist. My aim in writing articles on Medium is to document my learnings, deepen my understanding of topics related to data science, help others gain a deeper understanding of said topics, and make new friends along the way.

This repository was created to store my growing collection of Python code that is included as support visuals in my articles. I hope you will gain some value with this collection. Otherwise, constructive words of advice are always appreciated. 😊
